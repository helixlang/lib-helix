helix core/include
=================

overview
========

the `core/include` directory is a critical component of the helix project, containing all the `.h` files that define the c++ core of the helix runtime. these files provide the foundational c++ definitions required to support the helix compiler and runtime system.

this directory acts as the bridge between the helix language and its underlying c++ implementation, ensuring seamless integration and high performance.

purpose and functionality
=========================

- **c++ core definitions**:
  - this directory contains all the header files defining the core functionality of the helix runtime in c++.
  - these definitions are essential for the compiler and runtime to function correctly.

- **compiler dependency**:
  - the helix compiler relies on the definitions in this directory to translate helix code into executable binaries.

- **seamless integration**:
  - the header files in this directory are tightly integrated with the helix compiler and runtime, providing a robust and efficient foundation for all helix programs.

usage
=====

- **do not modify without expertise**:
  - modifying files in this directory requires an in-depth understanding of both the helix runtime and the underlying c++ implementation.
  - improper changes can result in compiler or runtime failures.

- **automatic inclusion**:
  - the files in `core/include` are automatically included by the helix compiler during the build process.
