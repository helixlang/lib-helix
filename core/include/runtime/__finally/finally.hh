/// \class $finally
///
/// Provides "finally" semantics in Helix, allowing guaranteed execution of cleanup or other
/// finalization code at the end of a scope, regardless of whether an exception or error occurred.
///
/// ### Purpose
/// `$finally` ensures that specific code is executed when the scope in which it resides is exited.
/// It is particularly useful for resource management, cleanup tasks, and ensuring consistent state,
/// especially in the presence of exceptions.
///
/// ### Features
/// - Executes a specified callable at the end of the scope.
/// - Can be used independently of `try-catch` blocks or in conjunction with them.
/// - Acts like `defer` in other langs, but with Helix-specific integration into `finally` blocks.
///
/// ### Usage
/// `$finally` can be used with:
/// 1. Standalone `finally` blocks:
///    ```helix
///    finally {
///        print("This always runs when the scope ends.");
///    }
///    ```
///
/// 2. `try-catch-finally` constructs:
///    ```helix
///    try {
///        some_erroring_function();
///    } catch {
///        print("Handling the error.");
///    } finally {
///        print("Cleaning up resources.");
///    }
///    ```
///
/// ### Implementation
/// - `$finally` wraps a callable provided at construction and executes it in its destructor.
/// - It leverages the `$function<void()>` type for callable storage, enabling type erasure and
///   support for various callable types such as lambdas, function pointers, and functors.
///
/// ### Example
/// ```helix
/// void example() {
///     finally {
///         print("This runs when 'example' exits.");
///     }
///
///     print("Doing something...");
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Notes
/// - This construct is unique to Helix and designed for maximum flexibility and simplicity.
/// - When combined with `try-catch`, it ensures code in the `finally` block executes regardless
///   of whether an error occurred in the `try` block.
///
/// ### Design
/// - `$finally` objects are non-copyable and non-movable to ensure that their associated callable
///   always runs at the intended scope exit.
/// - The destructor executes the stored callable if one was provided at construction.
///
/// ### Limitations
/// - `$finally` depends on `$function` for its callable implementation. Future work may involve
///   reducing this dependency for tighter integration with the Helix runtime.
