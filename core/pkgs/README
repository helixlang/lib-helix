helix core/pkgs
=============

overview
========

the `core/pkgs` directory is a critical component of the helix project runtime and compilation process. it contains runtime definitions written in helix, as well as core package files that are automatically included in the helix compilerâ€™s build process. this ensures that essential runtime behavior is universally available to all helix programs.

this directory is integral to the proper functioning of the helix compiler and should not be altered or removed without a thorough understanding of its implications.

purpose and functionality
=========================

- **compilation priority**:
  - the helix compiler processes files in this directory first, along with `core/include/core.h`, this ensures that essential runtime definitions are available to the compiler during the build process.
  - these files define runtime essentials that the compiler requires to process subsequent helix code.

- **automatic inclusion**:
  - all files in the `core/pkgs` directory are automatically included during the compilation process.

- **runtime definitions**:
  - defines foundational runtime behavior and utilities written in helix.

usage
=====

- **do not remove or modify without caution**:
  - removing or improperly modifying files in this directory can result in a non-functional compiler or runtime errors.
  - these files are required for the helix compiler to operate correctly.
