helix core
=============

overview
========

the `helix core` is a foundational component of the helix programming language, providing a set of core functionalities and definitions that are automatically included in every helix project. this ensures a consistent and robust starting point for all helix developers.

designed to streamline the development experience, the core eliminates the need for explicit imports of basic utilities and definitions, allowing you to focus on writing expressive and efficient code without repetitive boilerplate.

features
========

- **automatic inclusion**: the core is implicitly included in all helix projects, providing essential functionality without requiring explicit import statements.
- **comprehensive foundation**: includes core modules and utilities, ensuring that all helix projects start with the necessary building blocks.
- **seamless integration**: integrates smoothly with your codebase, offering a reliable and unobtrusive foundation for development.

directory structure
===================

this folder contains the following key components:

- `core_modules`: the primary definitions and utilities that make up the helix core.
- `internals`: internal files used to support core functionality. these are not directly accessible to the user.
- `docs`: detailed documentation explaining the components of the core and how they are used.

usage
=====

the helix core is automatically available in all projects. you do not need to import it manually or configure anything to use its features. simply start coding, and the core will ensure your project has the necessary tools and definitions.
